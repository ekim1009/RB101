         Welcome to Tic Tac Toe 
         The rules of Tic Tac Toe are as follows: 
         You will be the marker 'X' and the computer will be the marker 'O'
         You will alternate with the computer and mark an empty square
         The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row
         (up, down, across, or diagonally) will win that round
         First player to win five rounds will be the ultimate winner
         If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, it is a tie
